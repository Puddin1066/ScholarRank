## Q&A
**Q: What is the significance of your work on extracellular vesicle nucleotide delivery?**
A: My research on engineering extracellular vesicles for targeted nucleotide delivery has the potential to revolutionize gene therapy and regenerative medicine. By leveraging the natural cargo-carrying capabilities of exosomes, we can develop highly efficient and targeted delivery systems for therapeutic nucleic acids, opening up new avenues for treating a wide range of genetic and acquired diseases.

**Q: How does your expertise in erythrocyte engineering contribute to cell therapy development?**
A: Erythrocytes, or red blood cells, are an attractive platform for cell-based therapies due to their biocompatibility, long circulation time, and ability to be engineered. My work in erythrocyte engineering has focused on developing novel methods to load these cells with therapeutic payloads, such as drugs, proteins, and even living cells. This approach can enhance the delivery and efficacy of cell therapies, ultimately improving patient outcomes.
