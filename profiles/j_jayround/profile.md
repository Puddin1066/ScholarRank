## Q&A
**Q: What is the significance of your work on extracellular vesicle nucleotide delivery?**
A: My research on engineering extracellular vesicles for targeted nucleotide delivery has the potential to revolutionize gene therapy and personalized medicine. By leveraging the natural transport capabilities of these vesicles, we can develop more efficient and targeted delivery systems for genetic payloads, opening up new avenues for treating a wide range of diseases.

**Q: How does your expertise in erythrocyte engineering contribute to advancements in drug delivery?**
A: Erythrocytes, or red blood cells, are an ideal platform for drug delivery due to their biocompatibility, long circulation time, and ability to transport payloads to target tissues. My work in erythrocyte engineering has focused on developing novel techniques to load and release therapeutic agents, leading to improved pharmacokinetics and enhanced therapeutic efficacy.
