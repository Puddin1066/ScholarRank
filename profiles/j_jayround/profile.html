<h2>Q&amp;A</h2>

<p><strong>Q: What is your approach to translational exosome engineering?</strong>
A: My work in translational exosome engineering focuses on developing novel methods for loading and delivering therapeutic cargoes using engineered extracellular vesicles. By leveraging the natural properties of exosomes, we can create targeted delivery systems that overcome many of the challenges associated with traditional drug delivery approaches.</p>

<p><strong>Q: How do you apply your expertise in GEO data analysis to drug development?</strong>
A: GEO data analysis is a critical component of my work in drug development. By deeply interrogating gene expression datasets, I'm able to identify novel targets, understand disease mechanisms, and inform the design of targeted therapeutics. This data-driven approach helps accelerate the translation of promising drug candidates from the lab to the clinic.</p>
