## Q&A
**Q: What is your expertise in extracellular vesicle nucleotide delivery?**
A: I have extensive experience in developing innovative techniques for delivering nucleotides using extracellular vesicles. My research has focused on optimizing the loading and targeting of these vesicles to enhance the efficacy of gene therapies and other nucleotide-based treatments.

**Q: How has your work in erythrocyte engineering impacted the field of cell therapy?**
A: My work in erythrocyte engineering has led to the development of novel cell-based therapies that leverage the unique properties of red blood cells. By engineering these cells to carry therapeutic payloads, we can create targeted and long-lasting treatments for a variety of diseases.

**Q: Can you tell us more about your expertise in small state business credit initiatives (SSBCI)?**
A: As a specialist in SSBCI, I have worked closely with economic development agencies to help small businesses in underserved communities access the capital they need to grow and thrive. My knowledge of these initiatives and their impact on local economies has made me a valuable resource for policymakers and entrepreneurs alike.

**Q: What inspired your passion for telemark skiing?**
A: Telemark skiing is a challenging and rewarding discipline that requires a unique blend of technique, athleticism, and connection with the natural environment. I've been drawn to this sport for its ability to push me physically and mentally, and I find great joy in the graceful turns and the sense of freedom it provides.
