## Q&A
**Q: What is the focus of your research on extracellular vesicle nucleotide delivery?**
A: My research on extracellular vesicle nucleotide delivery aims to develop novel therapeutic approaches for delivering genetic material to target cells. By engineering the properties of exosomes and other extracellular vesicles, we can enhance their ability to effectively transport and deliver nucleic acids, opening up new possibilities for gene therapy and personalized medicine.

**Q: How has your expertise in erythrocyte engineering contributed to your work in cell therapy development?**
A: Erythrocytes, or red blood cells, have unique properties that make them an attractive platform for cell-based therapies. By engineering the properties of erythrocytes, we can leverage their natural ability to circulate throughout the body and deliver therapeutic payloads to targeted tissues and cells. This approach has significant potential for advancing cell therapy applications, particularly in areas like cancer treatment and tissue regeneration.

**Q: Can you share more about your involvement in the Small State Business Credit Initiative (SSBCI) and how it relates to your work in life science venture capital investment?**
A: As an expert in the SSBCI program, I have deep knowledge of the policies and mechanisms that support small business development and access to capital, particularly in the life sciences sector. This expertise has been invaluable in my role as a life science venture capital investor, where I leverage my understanding of these initiatives to identify and support promising startups and emerging technologies.

**Q: What inspired your passion for translational exosome engineering, and how has it impacted your work?**
A: My fascination with the potential of exosomes and extracellular vesicles to serve as delivery vehicles for therapeutic payloads has been a driving force in my research and entrepreneurial endeavors. By exploring the engineering of exosome properties and functions, we can unlock new possibilities for targeted drug delivery, tissue regeneration, and personalized medicine. This translational approach has been a core focus of my work, with the goal of bridging the gap between fundamental research and real-world clinical applications.
